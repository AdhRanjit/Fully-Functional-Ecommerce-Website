How to run the program?

First of all create virtual environment

> virtualenv venv

activate virtual env

> source venv/bin/activate

now install required libraries

> pip install -r requirements.txt

apply migrations

normally "python manage.py makemigrations && python manage.py migrate" will work but to be safe
use below command 

> python manage.py makemigrations && python manage.py migrate && python manage.py makemigrations home && python manage.py migrate && python manage.py makemigrations products && python manage.py migrate && python manage.py makemigrations accounts && python manage.py migrate

Now lets look inside .env file

EMAIL_HOST_USER => your gmail id
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD => password for gmail
STRIPE_PUBLIC => stripe public key
STRIPE_PRIVATE => stripe private key

now let's go to templates/account/cart.html

in line 112 add your public key inside Stripe('')

create a admin account

> python manage.py createsuperuser

and follow prompts on screen. This id and password will be used to login to admin panel

and finally we need to tell django what the domain of our website will be for that

> python manage.py shell
> from django.contrib.sites.models import Site
> site = Site.objects.get(id=1)
> site.domain = 'localhost:8000'\]
> site.name = 'BrandT'
> site.save()
> exit()

Doing this much will make a fully functional website.

Now you need to login using your super user id/password in admin panel and add desired products.

Note:

1) Pressing a button once will do the thing don't press it continiously (Sometime it is slow, i noticed lag on that so wait for sometime)
2) default card no. for stripe is 4242.......42 and, date and cvv can be anything

After running the file, if you want to run again later, you dont have to do it again:
follow this steps:
For my project: C:\Users\rjadh\OneDrive\Desktop\Program\SE_Project\Project\Client>
(Powershell)
1. Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
2. .\venv\Scripts\Activate
3. python manage.py runserver
4. open http://127.0.0.1:8000/ in website for website
5. http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/login/?next=/admin/ to login admin page
